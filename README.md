## üìú Introduction

This is the official implementation of our paper "[Riemannian Optimization on Relaxed Indicator Matrix Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20505)" . We propose a fundamental manifold in machine learning‚Äîthe Relaxed Indicator Matrix (RIM) manifold‚Äîand develop a set of Riemannian optimization methods on the RIM manifold.

> The optimization of the indicator matrix manifold is an NP-hard discrete optimization problem. We relax it into a continuous form, where each row is a probability vector summing to 1, and each column satisfies constraints within a certain range.

> These constraints are prior information that can be incorporated into machine learning systems. Specifically, when the column constraints are sufficiently relaxed, the manifold degenerates into a single-stochastic manifold, and when the constraints are sufficiently tight, it degenerates into a double-stochastic manifold. 

> Therefore, our manifold possesses generalizability.

## üîë Key Features and Contributions

- **Broad application space:** In most tasks such as clustering and classification that require learning an indicator matrix, relaxing to the RIM manifold may be a viable alternative to relaxing to the single-stochastic manifold (K-means) or the Stiefel manifold (spectral clustering).
- **Introducing column sum information:** Compared to other relaxation methods, this approach incorporates column sum information into the indicator matrix, representing the probability distribution of each category. This provides learning systems with additional prior information that can be leveraged.
- **Complete theory:** We provide a full proof, including the Riemannian gradient and Retraction mapping, ensuring the completeness of our work.
- Efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm: In some tests, the speed $\mathcal{O}(n)$ surpasses that of the double-stochastic manifold $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Additionally, compared to various existing algorithms, it achieves a lower optimization objective value. At the same time, it significantly improves clustering performance and can also serve as a post-processing tool to enhance clustering results.
